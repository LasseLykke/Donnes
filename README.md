# Donnes

### Building blocks: PHP and MySQL using mysqli and PDO.

Donn√©s is an internal tool that handles customer orders for SMB.
It is built with PHP and uses mySQL as a database.
The project was built because we needed a very simple way to handle customer orders, but would still be able to easily search them and not have to invest in a larger solution.
